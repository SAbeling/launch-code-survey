Since we don't have a direction yet I would like to propose one.

Long story short I did a project management class around a program I would want if I won the lottery and was able to help people the way I wanted to.  Now I propose we work on creating that program.

It has basically three parts to it.  The first is a questionaire which includes four branches of questions.  One is related to help with budget, one is related to social help, another is educational and finally employment.  

Second part is putting that data into a relational database.

Third is for the database to send out notifications for help in those areas.
